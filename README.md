# odin-recipes
This is my first project made as an assignment of The Odin Project Foundations Course.

This project is about creating a webpage that displays a few popular dishes and upon clicking on the dish link it gives a general description of the dish as well as recipe on that dish.

This will simply test my beginner HTML skills that I have learned in TheOdinProject Foundation Course.
